            <h3>Stations, lines, divisions, delays, uptown, downtown... what does it all <i>mean</i>?</h3>
            <p>
                I love the New York City Subway. In fact, I'd even go as far as to call it the best transportation method I've experienced. Though, parts of it surely aren't intuitive... at least at first.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you've ever found yourself asking what the colors mean, why there are letters <i>and</i> numbers, or perhaps just how the system came to be, you've come to the right place.

            <p>
                Let's get this straight: this isn't about the bus system, the Staten Island Ferry, or the Long Island Railroad.
            </p>
            <h4>(Those will be saved for another time...)</h4>
            <p>
                This is about the glorious <span class="emph">New York City Subway</span>. I'll cover all the basics, and a bit more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, if you can't already tell, I am what you could call <i>fond of subways</i>. For years, and sometimes I'm ashamed to admit it, I've spent a significant amount of my free time researching subway systems. I don't live in New York City, but I've spent enough time there and on the internet to be quite comfortable with the system, and now I want to talk about it!
            </p>
            <h4>If you ever meet me on the subway, I'll probably be telling you some esoteric subway history fact, and for that, I apologize in advance.</h4>
            <p>
                The first time on the subway is daunting. The network is <span class="emph">huge</span>. Like, 248 miles of track huge. The map on the wall certainly helps, but as a first-time rider, there are still some unanswered questions. <i>What does "express" mean?</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of this page isn't necessarily to "prepare you for your first time on the subway" <i>per se</i> (though it can certainly be used as such), but rather to enrich any knowledge you currently have about the subway, whether that's none, a little bit, or maybe even a lot.

            <h3>History &emsp; <span class="nextstops">Lines &emsp; Stations &emsp; Vehicles &emsp; Facts</span></h3>
            <p>
                Before any of the trains went underground, there were elevated railways in Lower Manhattan. Most notably, the first line of this sort was the <span class="emph2">IRT Ninth Avenue Line</span> which ran along Greenwich Street from Battery Place to Cortlandt Street, beginning in 1868.
            </p>
            <p>Hold on, let's back up a bit: <i>what on Earth is IRT?</i></p>
            <p>
                Though the New York City Subway now exists as one entity under the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, it wasn't always this way, believe it or not. In fact, in the earlier days of the subway, there were two main competing private transit operators: the <span class="emph2">Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)</span> and the <span class="emph2">Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT)</span>, which later became the <span class="emph2">Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT)</span>.
            </p>
            <p>I know this all sounds confusing, but trust me, it's important!</p>
            <p>
                Basically, throughout the late nineteenth century, elevated railways, run by the IRT, covered Lower Manhattan. By 1898 when the City of Greater New York was consolidated, creating the New York City we know today, the New York State Legislature had already authorized the <span class="emph2">Rapid Transit Act</span> which outlined the need for a future underground subway. The newly-formed Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners contracted with the IRT to have them construct the first route.
            </p>
            <p>
                On October 27, 1904, the IRT opened this new subway line, running from City Hall station in Lower Manhattan to 145th Street station in Harlem. This subway line roughly equates to the path of the modern 6 train south of Grand Central station, the 42nd Street Shuttle, and the path of the modern 1 train north of Times Square. Around this time, the BRT was working on servicing Brookyln and Queens, and began trying to connect Manhattan and Brooklyn with an underground line.
            </p>
            <h4>Let's fast forward a bit...</h4>
            <p>
                Years pass, trains are built, the BRT goes bankrupt and becomes the BMT, and perhaps most importantly, a new competitor joins the game in 1932: the city-owned <span class="emph2">Independent Subway System (IND)</span>. In 1940, the IND and the Board of Transportation took over the IRT and the BMT, unifying the networks into one system.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1953, the Board of Transportation was replaced with the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), which closed down many of the elevated lines where there were already nearby underground lines. I like to call this era the <i>beginning of subway modernity</i>. The NYCTA eventually became the more familiar <span class="emph2">MTA New York City Transit</span> that we know and love!
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="lines">
        <div class="lefttext">
            <h4 class="redtext">THIS IS &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; NEXT STOP</h4>
            <h3>Lines &emsp; <span class="nextstops">Stations &emsp; Vehicles &emsp; Facts &emsp; Conclusion</span></h3>
            <p>
                When the consolidated NYCTA united the IRT, BMT, and IND, there was one problem: the IRT cars ran on narrower tracks than the others!
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, how do we fix this?
            </p>
            <h4><i>How about we just, like, not unite them completely?</i></h4>
            <h4><i>&emsp;&emsp; — someone at the NYCTA, probably</i></h4>
            <p>
                Thus, the former IRT lines became part of the <span class="emph3">A Division</span> and the former BMT and IND lines became part of the <span class="emph3">B Division</span>. In fact, most lines maintain their former company's title at the start of their name!
            </p>
            <p>
                However, not all trains that are part of a specific line necessarily follow the same path. For example, the <strong>1</strong> train's path splits from the path of the <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong> north of W 102nd St in the Upper West Side, despite all being part of the same line. This difference is key to understanding the subway: there are often different <span class="emph3">routes</span>, also called <span class="emph3">services</span>, grouped together in a line.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another important distinction to be made is between <span class="emph3">Local</span> and <span class="emph3">Express</span> trains. A Local train (e.g., the <strong>1</strong>) visits all stations along the line, while an Express train (e.g., the <strong>3</strong>) visits only some of these stations, or only visits certain stations at specific times.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll try to illustrate this: the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line is a <i>line</i> that is followed by routes <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, and <strong>3</strong>. However, the <strong>1</strong> is the only train that follows this line for the entirety of its route, whereas the <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong> branch off, following other lines including, for example, the IRT Lenox Avenue Line. Because the <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong> still follow the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line through most of Manhattan, they are considered to be part of this line, and thus they are assigned the red label along with the <strong>1</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, and <strong>3</strong> are routes, while the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line is a line that they all follow.
            </p>

                You may notice that all A Division routes* are labelled with <span class="emph3">numbers</span>, while all B Division routes are labelled with <span class="emph3">letters</span>! So next time you hop on that <strong>5</strong> train, you'll know you're riding what once was part of the IRT, and what is now numbered as a result of its narrowness...

                Now, colloquially speaking, you'd get some strange looks if you told someone you were taking the <i>Second Avenue/Broadway Express/Brighton Local</i> route, and few New Yorkers would know what you're even referring to. Generally speaking, commuters address their route as the associated emblem, i.e. you're far more likely to hear something along the lines of "I'm taking the <strong>Q train</strong> uptown."

                The New York City Subway has more stations than any other subway system in the world. In fact, with 424 stations, it's well ahead of the Shanghai Metro's 381 stations, the system second on the list.

                In fact, by some definitions, New York has got even <i>more</i> than 424 stations. You see, large stations in New York that connect more than one line (whether through different floors, or through connecting pedways) are known as <span class="emph4">station complexes</span>. If the stations for each line at a station complex were individually counted as their own stations, the total number of stations in the system would rise to 472.

                Stations in Manhattan often express direction using a binary of <span class="emph4">uptown</span> and <span class="emph4">downtown</span>. These mean exactly what you'd think they mean: the former refers to trains moving northbound, and the latter refers to trains moving southbound. Trains that extend into other boroughs also tend to include the boroughs alongside the direction within Manhattan. For example, at Wall Street station located at the intersection of Wall Street and Broadway in the Financial District, signage on the staircases on the west side of Broadway indicates that its direction is <span class="emph4">Downtown & Brooklyn</span>, while the trains on the east side of the street head toward <span class="emph4">Uptown & The Bronx</span>, according to the signs. Some stations are like this, where the passenger must enter the station from a certain entrance, depending on where they're headed. This follows a general rule: uptown trains are found on the east side of an avenue, and downtown trains are found on the west side.

                Stations in New York can often look similar, but some are unique and really interesting to check out. My favorite, for example, is 81st Street-Natural History Museum station in the Upper West Side, where you can find murals and fossils on the walls.
